# Python Web Scraping Project

This project consists of several Python scripts that use web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract data or automate interactions on various websites.

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`**:  
  Scrapes quotes and their authors from a website using BeautifulSoup.
  
- **`another.py`**:  
  Uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape job listings from LinkedIn. It interacts with the LinkedIn job page to extract data dynamically.

- **`andyetanother.py`**:  
  Automates playing the Cookie Clicker game using Selenium by automatically clicking the cookie and making upgrades based on the number of cookies collected.

- **`bcgame.py`**:  
  Attempts to automate playing a game on bcgame.com. However, due to restrictions and security measures on the site, this script may not work consistently.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `selenium`
  - `webdriver-manager`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 selenium webdriver-manager
```

## How to Run the Scripts

### `main.py`
This script scrapes quotes and authors from a website:

```bash
python main.py
```

### `another.py`
This script scrapes job listings from LinkedIn. Make sure you have your LinkedIn credentials available, as this may require logging into LinkedIn:

```bash
python another.py
```

### `andyetanother.py`
Automates the Cookie Clicker game by repeatedly clicking the cookie and upgrading based on cookies collected:

```bash
python andyetanother.py
```

### `bcgame.py`
Automates playing a game on bcgame.com. Due to restrictions on the site, it may not work every time:

```bash
python bcgame.py
```

## Notes

- **LinkedIn Scraping**: Ensure compliance with LinkedInâ€™s terms of service while scraping job listings.
- **bcgame Automation**: The script for bcgame.com may experience intermittent failures due to anti-bot measures on the site.
